                        The songs being played in my head <br>
                        Doesn’t make any sense <br>
                        Neither does a poem that <br>
                        breezes through my lip                     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        songs now have been <br>
                        over-exaggerated pain <br>
                        and sometimes <br>
                        over exaggerated happiness

                    <p>
                        the poem now has been <br>
                        chewed and spat
                        out by people <br>
                        and that doesn’t make any sense

                    <p>
                        as senseless <br>
                        as the world that drowns <br>
                        all the songs and poem <br>
                        prose now don’t feel
                        real <br>

                        it's like a child saying
                        “she is fine” <br>
                        when she lost her barbie <br>
                        which she dreamed to wash <br>
                        and make it clean 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        she couldn’t wash it <br>
                        neither did she sing all prose she wrote for it <br>
                        all writes did lose like how breath lost in a fog
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everything lost <br>
                        A promise of a son to make his dad proud <br>
                        To hug his mom,
                        Child to wash her barbie <br>
                        Poet to complete his poem
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of him to make his audience <br>
                        Understand the internal meaning <br>
                        Of the prose, he’s been writing <br>
                        For the way too long
