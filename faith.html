                    <p>
                        Ways separated due to guesses <br>
                        Also, for the complexities to face it <br>
                        I thought I would make it <br>
                        Without you even helping <br>
                        Now its been to wicked <br>
                        Also been too gloomy <br>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With lonesome nights
                        But stars blooming, <br>
                        I could pretend that its fine <br>
                        Dance with eyes closed <br>
                        Stop playing with my shades <br>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Will see the mountain
                        Mountain, from the window <br>
                        Mountain as gigantic
                        As you say <br>
                        How blameless I am 
                        You know <br>
                        I would not believe that 
                        As for now, <br>
                        I think I am Tiny <br>
                        As tiny as the small rock in that mountain <br>
                        If I crumble, <br>
                        Another rock could take my place <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But for now, <br>
                        Dont worry about me <br>
                        I am just scattered myself <br>
                        Lost, helpless <br>
                        Lost hopeless <br>
                        Tiresome of finding own self <br>
                        But time I would be with you <br>
                        Maybe I would glow and <br>
                        All lonesomeness may blow <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I reckon, I need
                        a trail to follow <br>
                        which leads me with flow <br>
                        Then I can tell to my self <br>
                        I have made it <br>
                        Without you even helping
                    </p>
